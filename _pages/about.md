Hi, I'm Carlos Ra√∫l, an optimistic 19-year-old Physics university student from [UNMSM](https://unmsm.edu.pe). Passionate about getting higher education in the field of mathematical-computational modeling of physical phenomena. :D

## Research Interests

- Mathematical and computational modeling in hydrology.
  ### $ \frac{\partial (\rho u_{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial[\rho u_{i}u_{j}]}{\partial x_{j}} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} + \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_{j}} + \rho f_{i} $
  
- Computer Simulation
