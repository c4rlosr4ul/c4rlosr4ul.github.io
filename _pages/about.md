I am a physicist and machine learning researcher working on the application of state of the art data science techniques in the area of high-energy particle physics. I am particularly interested in computer vision techniques used on datasets generated by the ATLAS detector at the LHC and techniques to overcome the ``black box'' problem in machine learning to better understand how and what neural networks learn from complicated high-dimensional features. 

Research Interests
======
- ML Model Interpretability/Intelligibility
- Black Box testing and Data Mining
- Dimensionality Reduction and Processing Abstract Features to Human-Readable Information
- Causality and guided learning
