Work experience
======
<!-- * 2015 - Present: UC Irvine, Graduate Research Assistant
  * Designed techniques for simplifying complex "multi-model" ML problems into simpler and morepowerful single-model methods to improve speedy, accuracy and model intelligibility.
  * Advanced model accuracy and performance on active ML problems over "state of the art" techniquesused at the LHC.
  * Invented a methodology for performing feature dimensionality reduction to produce highly efficient,powerful and interpretable training features.

* 2011 - 2015: University of Hawaii, Graduate Research Assistant
  * Designed Bose-Einstein Condensate simulations for a DoD funded lattice gas quantum computingexperiment.
  * Interfaced analysis and trigger system code to FPGA hardware on a neutrino telescope.

* 2009 - 2011: Northrop Grumman, Systems Engineer
  * Designed and oversaw the deployment of a secure PTP radio network for Air Force installations.
  * Managed network security/stability and worked as the Air Force point-of-contact for systemmanagement and reliability metrics.
  * Obtained a secret security clearance.
